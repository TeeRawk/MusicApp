##Requirements

Min SDK version 16

##Installing with [Gradle](http://gradle.org/)

##Usage

Include the library as local library project.

Second include PullToRefreshView to your layout, with the app:type="soup"

```xml
<com.yalantis.pulltomakesoup.PullToRefreshView
    android:id="@+id/pull_to_refresh"
    app:type="soup"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent">

    <android.support.v7.widget.RecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/recycler_view"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:divider="@null"
        android:dividerHeight="0dp"
        android:fadingEdge="none"/>

</com.yalantis.pulltomakesoup.PullToRefreshView>
```

Next in your onCreate method refer to the View and setup OnRefreshListener.

```java
mPullToRefreshView = (PullToRefreshView) findViewById(R.id.pull_to_refresh);
mPullToRefreshView.setOnRefreshListener(new PullToRefreshView.OnRefreshListener() {
    @Override
    public void onRefresh() {}
});
```

When you need to finish the refreshing call

```java
mPullToRefreshView.setRefreshing(false);

# Misc
If you need to change progress state:
```java
	mPullToRefreshView.setRefreshing(boolean isRefreshing)
```
